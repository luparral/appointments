        }
    ]
}

```

The possible types of errors are:

- invalid_doctor: the doctor first or last name are null.
- invalid_duration_in_minutes: the duration in minutes is 0
- invalid_service: the service price is 0 or the service name is null
- invalid_location: the location name or timeZoneCode are null
- invalid_id: the id is null
- invalid_time: the time is null


### API Components

The Following diagram roughly illustrates how the API works.

![APFlow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8027371/131234481-139ccf94-8c5c-4f52-beb0-d6ac1c87500b.png)


Basically, when the `GET localhost:8080/api/v1/doctor/appointments` endpoint is called, the HTTP GET Request to https://us-central1-sesame-care-dev.cloudfunctions.net/sesame_programming_test_api is performed. 

The **AppointmentsService** then reads and parses the JSON data and creates a list of `Appointment` objects that are stored in memory. 

At the same time, the non-valid `Appointments` (the ones that have any missing field) are sent to the **AppointmentErrorService** to create an `AppointmentError` for this appointment.

Once all the `Appointment`s are created, the `APIResponse` will be created by calling both the **AppointmentErrorService** to get all the `AppointmentErrors` and the **DoctorAppointmentsService** to obtain all the `DoctorAppointments`. 

To get a better idea of this classes, you can take a look at this other diagram

![Classes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8027371/131234575-642cb362-9868-43d6-943f-9d857f14ea31.png)

The only thing left to mention is the algorithm that transform the `Appointment` into a `DoctorAppointment`. Let's do it ðŸš€ 

For each `Appointment`, we check if we already have a `DoctorAppointment` entry for the `Doctor` of this `Appointment`.

If we don't, then everything is great and we just have to create an new `DoctorAppointment` entry for this `Appointment`.

If we do, then we have to update this Doctor's record, by adding a new `AppointmentByLocation` entry if we don't have an entry for this location, or just a `ShortAppointment` entry if we already have the location as well.


### Room for improvement

Here is some stuff that would be nice to fix or add.

- `startDateTime` should be ISO Date, and it should take into account the timeZoneCode.
- `duration` should be an ISO Duration. Maybe there is some library to transform from minutes to this format.
- Take a closer look to error handling, exception throwing and catching, and also logging.
